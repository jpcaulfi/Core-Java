# Seaborn

This program accesses Yahoo Finance's API via RapidAPI.com and relays to the Jupiter Group Discord server vital information about the markets.

As of right now, Seaborn is designed to disclose to traders upcoming Earnings Releases and recap the Earnings Releases that it posted the prior day.

In the future, Seaborn will monitor stock price data to identify trends, similar to the Algorithm Trading Bots that can be found in my GitHub. 

Seaborn will also involve more catalysts and news articles as development progresses.
