# Core-Java

Various projects I've built using core Java.

"Seaborn" is an automated bot designed to push message embeds to the Jupiter Discord server regarding potential market-moving catalysts and subsequent trading opportunities.

"Van Repairs" is a program designed to help management at Amazon keep track of repairs needed to vans by recording messages submitted in a chat server by drivers and automating the recording of maintenance details.
